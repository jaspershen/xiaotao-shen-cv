	abstract = {Multiomics data fusion integrates diverse data modalities, ranging from transcriptomics to proteomics, to gain a comprehensive understanding of biological systems and enhance predictions on outcomes of interest related to disease phenotypes and treatment responses. Cooperative learning, a recently proposed method, unifies the commonly-used fusion approaches, including early and late fusion, and offers a systematic framework for leveraging the shared underlying relationships across omics to strengthen signals. However, the challenge of acquiring large-scale labeled data remains, and there are cases where multiomics data are available but in the absence of annotated labels. To harness the potential of unlabeled multiomcis data, we introduce semi-supervised cooperative learning. By utilizing an "agreement penalty", our method incorporates the additional unlabeled data in the learning process and achieves consistently superior predictive performance on simulated data and a real multiomics study of aging. It offers an effective solution to multiomics data fusion in settings with both labeled and unlabeled data and maximizes the utility of available data resources, with the potential of significantly improving predictive models for diagnostics and therapeutics in an increasingly multiomics world.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities exert a substantial influence on human health and have been unequivocally associated with a spectrum of human maladies, encompassing conditions such as anxiety1, depression2, hypertension3, cardiovascular diseases4, obesity4,5, diabetes6, inflammatory bowel disease7, and cancer8,9. This intricate interplay between microbiota community structures and host pathophysiology has kindled substantial interest and spurred active research endeavors across various scientific domains. Despite significant strides in sequencing technologies, which have unveiled the vast diversity of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems, the analysis of microbiome data remains a formidable challenge. The complexity inherent in such data, compounded by the absence of standardized data processing and analysis workflows, continues to pose substantial hurdles. The tidyverse paradigm, comprised of a suite of R packages meticulously crafted to facilitate efficient data manipulation and visualization, has garnered considerable acclaim within the data science community10. Its appeal stems from its innate simplicity and efficacy in organizing and processing data10. In recent times, a plethora of tools have been devised to address distinct omics data processing and analysis needs, including notable initiatives such as the tidymass project11, tidyomics project12, tidymicro13, and MicrobiotaProcess13,14. However, a conspicuous gap persists in the form of a standardized, tidyverse-based package for seamless and rigorous microbiome data processing and analysis.
To address this burgeoning demand for standardized and reproducible microbiome data analysis, we introduce microbiomedataset, an R package that embraces the tidyverse ethos to furnish a structured framework for the organization and processing of microbiome data. Microbiomedataset offers a comprehensive, customizable solution for the management, structuring, and processing of microbiome data. Importantly, this package seamlessly integrates with established bioinformatics tools, facilitating its incorporation into existing analytical pipelines11,13,14,15. Within this manuscript, we proffer an in-depth overview of the microbiomedataset package, elucidating its multifarious functionalities. Moreover, we substantiate its utility through illustrative case studies employing a publicly available microbiome dataset. It is imperative to underscore that microbiomedataset constitutes an integral component of the larger tidymicrobiome project, accessible via www.tidymicrobiome.org. Tidymicrobiome epitomizes an ecosystem of R packages that share a coherent design philosophy, grammar, and data structure, collectively engendering a robust, reproducible, and object-oriented computational framework. This project's development has been guided by several key tenets: (1) Cross-platform compatibility, (2) Uniformity, shareability, traceability, and reproducibility, and (3) Flexibility and extensibility. We further expound upon the advantages inherent in adopting a tidyverse-style framework for microbiome data analysis, underscoring the pronounced benefits in terms of standardization and reproducibility that microbiomedataset offers. In sum, microbiomedataset furnishes an accessible and efficient avenue for microbiome data analysis, catering to both neophyte and seasoned R users alike.},

	abstract = {Pregnancy is a critical time that has long-term impacts on both maternal and fetal health. During pregnancy, the maternal metabolome undergoes dramatic systemic changes, although correlating longitudinal changes in maternal urine remain largely unexplored. We applied an LCMS-based untargeted metabolomics profiling approach to analyze 346 longitudinal maternal urine samples collected throughout pregnancy for 36 women from diverse ethnic backgrounds with differing clinical characteristics. We detected 20,314 metabolic peaks and annotated 875 metabolites. Altered metabolites include a broad panel of glucocorticoids, lipids, and amino acid derivatives, which revealed systematic pathway alterations during pregnancy. We also developed a machine-learning model to precisely predict gestational age (GA) at time of sampling using urine metabolites that provides a non-invasive method for pregnancy dating. This longitudinal maternal urine study demonstrates the clinical utility of using untargeted metabolomics in obstetric settings.

	abstract = {NGLY1 (N-glycanase 1) deficiency is a rare congenital recessive disorder of protein deglycosylation unaddressed by the current standard of care. Using combined metabolomics and proteomics profiling, we show that NGLY1 deficiency activates the immune response and disturbs lipid metabolism, biogenic amine synthesis, and glutathione metabolism. These alterations were also observed in NGLY1 deficient patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which serve as personalized cellular models of the disease. These findings provide molecular insight into the pathophysiology of NGLY1 deficiency and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.},
